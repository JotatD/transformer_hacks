# Transformer Hacks

This repository consists on several add-ons to Karpathy's Nano-GPT for research purposes.\

So far we have a decoder only time series forecaster that works surprisingly well, an encoder-decoder forecaster that works surprisingly 
bad (based on *Deep Transformer Models for Time Series Forecasting: The Influenza Prevalence Case*), and a Decision Transformer for 
reinforcement learning (based on *Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling*).
