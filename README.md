# Transformer Hacks

This repository consists on several add-ons to Karpathy's Nano-GPT for research purposes.

So far we have:

* A decoder only time series forecaster that works surprisingly well,
* An encoder-decoder forecaster that works surprisingly bad (based on *Deep Transformer Models for Time Series Forecasting: The Influenza Prevalence Case*)
* A Decision Transformer for reinforcement learning (based on *Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling*).
* A Trajectory Transformer with uniform discretizer for reinforcement learning (based on *Reinforcement learning as one big sequence modelling problem*)
